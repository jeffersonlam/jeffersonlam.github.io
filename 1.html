		<h2>Setting things up</h2>
		<h5>January 18th, 2015</h5>
		<div class="blog-content">
			<p>Let's get this thing working. If you're reading this, you've somehow stumbled upon my completely under-construction website. Welcome.</p>
			<p>This year, 2015, I want to create something with code every week.</p>
			<p>I don't know yet how to define "something with code." They could be small stand-alone things, or I could keep building on my previoius work with each project.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, the point is that I want to code more this year. Last year, 2014, I hardly coded at all. It's kind of ironic, considering I got a new job in IBM as a front-end developer. This year, I'm going to change that by coding as much as I can.</p>
			<p>My first project of the year, completed last week, was <a href="http://jeffersonlam.github.io/weathery/">Weathery</a>. I think I'll write a separate post about that.</p>
			<p>This week, as my second project... well, I've been putting together this website and messing around with the CSS way too much, but I haven't created anything substantial. I've been looking into AngularJS a lot more, and I'm going to try to create something in Angular as an excercise in practicing that framework.</p>
